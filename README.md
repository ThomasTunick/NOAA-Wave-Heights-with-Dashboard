Processed 3 years of raw .gz buoy data from NOAA buoys recording the North and South shores of Oahu
Calculated daily, weekly, and monthly average wave heights then used that data to build a streamlit app with filters and line plots by region and added a summary stats for monthly showing the highest avergae wave height month and lowest average wave height month
Had to learn how to understand and navigate NOAA's raw data and had trouble with missing points in the streamlit plot due to groupby and resample dropping certain points in weekly and monthly and replacing them with null values.
Learned to clean and process real world time series data, group and resample data by time and category, how to use streamlit and make a simple dashboard, and methods for troubleshooting when running into errors
